Inversity Team Challenge - Chris and Josh

Run run_script.py to run the script - the filepath of the research paper/report will need to be entered.

A handful of scripts for calling ChatGPT based on Chris' previous Inversity submissions.

A hanful of test scripts made, some stored in their own folder, others without due to having to point them at the Root filepath to import.
